    <h1>Charminar: A Historic Symbol of Hyderabad</h1>
    <img src="https://image3.mouthshut.com/images/imagesp/925752464s.jpg" />
    <p>
      Charminar is perhaps one of the best landmarks in India that holds immense significance. Constructed in the year 1591, it has stood tall ever since as the iconic symbol of Hyderabad. It also houses a mosque within its architecture, representing the Indo-Islamic fusion of art and culture. It is one of the prime tourist attractions in the city that draws a large number of visitors each year. Major festivals like Ramzan are celebrated here according to the government. People from various cultures visit the nearby markets to observe the beauty of this historic monument during festive times.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1591, King Muhammad Quli Qutub Shah, the ruler of the Qutub Shahi Dynasty, had this monument constructed after he moved to the city from Golconda. The primary reason for adding four minarets to the design was to represent the four directions. It was also a tribute to his beloved wife, Queen Bhagwati. He saw her for the first time at this location and fell deeply in love with her. He was also a poet, and prayed using his verses for the protection and prosperity of this monument.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charminar stands at 48.7 meters in height. The four minarets face each other and have a long-drawn gallery. The monument is made of limestone, crushed marbles, and stone. It is estimated that the total weight of this structure is 14,000 tons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charminar also has a secret tunnel that connects it to Golconda Fort. This tunnel was constructed as an escape route and a safety measure for the King and others visiting the fort. Wazu Khana, a place inside the monument, was built where people used to perform ablutions before praying. At one point, there was a fountain in the center.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many historians believe that this monument was built to mark the end of a deadly plague that ravaged the area at the time. Some other accounts describe it as the ‘Arch De Win of the East’. The monument is built in the shape of a square and has four clocks facing each direction. The four minarets are said to represent the four Khalifas of Islam, according to some historians.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prayer area of the mosque is located on the top of this monument. In earlier times, a madrasa or school operated on the ground floor. The minarets were designed to oversee the entire city in those days. The city was then developed around this monument, and since then, the city has flourished. It remains the heart of the city. Tourists can see streets emanating from this area and entering the city like a network.
    </p>
    <p>
      A huge local market surrounds Charminar, known for its bangles. Laad Market is famous for its local jewelry. Patther Gatti is a well-known market for pearls. Sarojini Naidu, the Nightingale of India, was born and raised in this area. She described these local markets with her words in the poem ‘In the Markets of Hyderabad’.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charminar is an important structure in the enriched history of India. It marks the Sultanate rule in the southern part of India. This beautiful monument and its architecture attract numerous tourists from all over the world every year.
