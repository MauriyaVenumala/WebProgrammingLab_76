	<li>1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves</li>

<font size = "15" style = "color:#e3fa52;text-shadow: 2px 2px #4203f9"><b> Directions</b></font>

   <b>Step 1</b>

   Whisk the whole egg, egg yolk, 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and 1 tablespoon water in a small liquid measuring cup until smooth. 
   Combine the flour and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a food processor, 2 to 3 pulses. 
   With the food processor running, drizzle in the egg mixture and process until the dough forms into small pebbles that resemble couscous and doesnâ€™t stick to your fingers when pinched, 2 to 3 minutes. 
   If the dough is too dry, add water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until it comes together. If the dough is too wet, add flour, 1 tablespoon at a time.

   <b>Step 2</b>

   Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead until a smooth ball forms, 4 to 5 times. Place in a bowl and refrigerate until chilled, about 30 minutes

   <b>Step 3</b>

   Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add the celery and onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, 4 to 5 minutes. 
   Add the carrots and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in the thyme, garlic, 2 teaspoons salt and a few grinds of pepper. 
   Cook until the garlic softens, about 1 minute, then stir in the chicken stock and bay leaves. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally, 7 to 8 minutes.

   <b>Step 4</b>

   Reduce the heat to low to maintain a simmer. 
   Grate one-third of the dough on the large holes of a box grater directly into the hot broth, tapping the grater on the edge of pot to release the noodles as needed.
